# Color-Mixer-with-Slider-Bars (According to project discription by Professor Xiang)

An interactive Color Mixer with 3 Slide Bars: Red, Green and Blue. User can set color for the square and rectangle windows.

User can slide any slide bar to get Red, Green or Blue in the pixel range from 0 to 255. The squre window will show the mixed color which User set.

User can also set the left or right side color of rectangle window by using the current color in the Square window. Then the color of the rectangle window would show the effect of linear intetpolation between the color of its left and right edges. 

The user can choose a slider by moving the cursor over the slide bar (turn gray when cursor is on the bar) and pushing the left mouse button. As long as the button is held down the slide bar is attached to the cursor in the vertical direction, and the user can move the cursor(i.e.,the slide bar) up and down to adjust the value of the corresponding primary. The color of the square region should change instantaneously according to the movement of the cursor, and the number on top of the slide bar should always indicate the current value of the primary. The user may also put the sursor on a slider track and press the left button to reposition and engage the corresponding slide bar. 

The user can hit the "L" key at any time to make the current color (shown in the square region) the color of the left edge of the rectangular region, and hit the "r" key at any time to make the current color the color of the right edge. The rectangular region should be update instantaneously when any changes is made to its color on either side. 

In addition, if the cursor is inside the rectangular region and the user clicks the left button, then the value and position of the three slide bars will change immediately to show the primary components of the color at the cursor, and the color of the square region also changes accordingly.
